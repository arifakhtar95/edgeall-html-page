                    <h2>Enriching the young kids with humble roots- EdgeALL!</h2>
                    <h4>“The only way to Learn Mathematics is to do Mathematics - Paul Halmos” </h4>
                    <p>On the same lines of our own Los Gatos famous Mathematician Paul Halmos principles, EdgeAll Inc is established on humble beginnings, instilling the importance of practice and discipline in the everyday life of our kids. We are Diwakar and Sunita, who like all parents out there, wanted our two children to realize the importance of education. We understood the role that academics play in providing a solid foundation for succeeding in life along with other traits such as grit and curiosity. While Sciences and Arts are crucially important as well, math is where a majority of students face challenges and need practice. We started to look around for help.</p>

                    <p>Although there were many tutoring centers around our area, finding time in our and the kids' ever changing schedule was difficult. The lack of progress reporting always made us question the real progress our kids were making. Was the money we were investing into this benefitting our child? Over a period, the cost of tutoring also became significant. After talking with other parents, we realized that we were not alone. Many parents were facing the same challenges. We wanted a solution where my children could learn and build unforgettable concepts with everyday practice and reach perfection over time in an enjoyable way where they realized with hard work they could achieve what they wanted. While their learning was made fun, We also wanted a system which could provide an easy to use, individualized and collaborative learning environment with the parent or any tutor without having to worry about setting aside a lot of time in preparing content, grading or for tracking the kids progress. Out of this need edgeAll was born.</p>
